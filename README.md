### Description
A platform that allows users generate QR code 
that specifically does something when scanned.

View and Interact with the documentation
Register to view more details
No access to use until registered
####	User: Authenticated
Full access to the platform
Allow setting on what should happen when qr is scanned - give at least 2 options
Allow user to download (allow png, jpeg and pdf download format), or share code by email or social media
Allow user save data and come back to it.

##### Project Scope
A QR code (quick response code) is a type of two dimensional (2D) barcode consisting of an array of black and white squares that is used to provide easy access to online information through a digital camera on a smartphone or tablet. QR code generator is an online software that is used to generate or create QR codes for storing any digital information. This project aims to make sure QR codes are generated quickly and easily. QR codes let’s you create memorable marketing campaigns with trackable QR codes designed by you, by uploading a file or Link then the generator converts them into a url and embeds the link to the QR code. With QR-Gen we hope to promote interaction, engagement and also create a landing Page after our user Research.

##### PROBLEM STATEMENT 
QR codes are used to track product information, and many smartphones include built-in QR scanners. QR codes are used for marketing and advertising by a variety of industries, including restaurants, for product packaging, postal services,banks, libraries, and retail stores.
 
QR codes are meant to be simple and easy to use that is why it is called “Quick Response” but secondary research has shown that a lot of these QR platforms are difficult and frustrating for new users and they do not allow users to access information instantly. Also, Some of these platforms request for payment before users can generate a QR code.
 
To solve this, we will create a free QR platform that would give users a smooth experience when they generate QR codes. 
 
The generated QR code can be downloaded as PDF, among other features, and when scanned will take you to the user's website.

##### RESEARCH BACKGROUND.
 
Currently in the project phase under the Zuri training, user research is being carried out on the project topic assigned to our group as part of the requirement of the programme.
 
Technological advances brought an easy way to store, access, share and download digital information. The QR (quick response) codes are one of these innovations. 
 
Why type when you can scan? 
We aim to design and build a platform that generates a QR code when users upload a link or PDF.
QR codes consist of black modules arranged in a square pattern on a white background, the color of the modules can be customized.
QR codes can be two dimensional, meaning it can be scanned in two directions (horizontal or vertical) or a one dimensional barcode, this requires a more sophisticated reader.
 
A QR_gen is a website that is used to create or generate these QR codes that store digital information. The user uploads the PDF file or a link to generate the QR code, which can be shared or downloaded. There are two types of QR codes; static and dynamic. The digital information in static QR codes are hard-coded and cannot be changed but in dynamic QR codes, the information can be edited even after the QR code is deployed.

##### Modalities for QR_gen
A. Features for unauthenticated users
1. Landing Page: 
         Displaying Basic information about the site-  header 
          Nav bar
          QR code generator itself etc.
           2. Demo button to a page that demonstrates how the QR code works( to allow viewers interact with the documentation)
           “Get more” ( for maybe more design options)button that will lead to
3. An alert which says users would have to sign up before gaining access to the feature.
 
4. A register/ sign up page
 
Authenticated Users
1. Full access to the site
2. New dashboard with: a new set of nav bars( just two- url,pdf)
3. A download button that would enable users to share with other platforms such as email or Social Media 
4. A page for users to track all their generated codes therefore a “saved” documents folder that they can come back to.

##### User case Scenario 
I am a HR manager, I set up my account with the application. Then I paste my LinkedIn link and a QR code is generated for me. I have the option of downloading the code as PNG,JPEG,PDF or sharing code by email or social media.
